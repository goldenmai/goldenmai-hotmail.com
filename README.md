Bill Gates said that we are not ready for next break in 2015, as now we are deep traped in COVID-19 pandemic. He showed an interesting simulation of the spread of the virus over the word with the time. it looks very impressive.
Since pandemic can not be vanished, it will come again and again, and even more often. During the pandemic, data was changed so fast, and too many fake news are spreded in the social media, I'd like to build my own view with some source which I can trust.

I'll collect data and simulate it with python. 

I'd like to simulate the data on the map, it should be a good practice for usage of python.
