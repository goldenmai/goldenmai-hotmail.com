Bill Gates said that we are not ready for next break in 2015, as now we are deep traped in COVID-19 pandemic. He showed an interesting simulation of the spread of the virus over the word with the time. it looks very impressive.
Since pandemic can not be vanished, it will come again and again, and even more often. During the pandemic, data was changed so fast, and too many fake news are spreded in the social media, I'd like to build my own view with some source which I can trust.

I'll collect data and simulate it with python. 

I'd like to simulate the data on the map, it should be a good practice for usage of python.

Description: g0v.tw is an online community that pushes information transparency, focusing on developing information platform and tools for the citizens to participate in society. Substituting the ‚Äúo‚Äù with ‚Äú0‚Ä≥ in gov, the new ‚Äúg0v‚Äù not only stands for rethinking the role that the government plays from the bottom up, but also represents the world view of 0 and 1 in the digital natives generation. Based on the spirit of open source, g0v cares about freedom of speech and open data, writing code to provide citizens the easy-to-use information service. The transparency of information can help citizens to have a better understanding on how the government works, to understand the issues faster and to avoid media monopoly, so they can monitor the government more efficiently, and become involved in actions and finally deepen the quality of democracy.
